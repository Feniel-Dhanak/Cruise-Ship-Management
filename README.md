# Cruise Ship Management System (CSM)

*A Web-Based Management and Voyager Platform*

---

## 1. Introduction

The **Cruise Ship Management System (CSM)** is a web-based application designed to streamline operations for cruise ships while providing voyagers (passengers) with a smooth and engaging user experience. It is developed using **JavaScript** for the logic and front-end, **Firebase** for authentication and backend integration, and custom UI styling and responsive design.

 This project integrates features for multiple roles: **Admin, Supervisor, Manager, and Voyager**. Each role has its own dashboard, ensuring clear separation of responsibilities and secure access to relevant functionality.

---

## 2. Objectives

* To build a **multi-role platform** that manages cruise operations efficiently.
* To implement **role-based authentication and access control**.
* To design **interactive dashboards** for each role with intuitive UI/UX.
* To ensure **responsive design** for all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* To integrate essential functionalities such as bookings, ordering, item management, and voyager registration.

## 3. Technologies Used

* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Backend / Database**: Firebase Authentication & Firestore Database.
* **Styling & UI**: Custom CSS, gradient designs, hover animations, responsive grid layouts.

## 4. System Architecture

The system follows a **role-based architecture**. After authentication, users are redirected to dashboards specific to their roles.

### Roles and Responsibilities:

* **Admin**

  * Manage catering and stationery items.
  * Register voyagers with secure authentication.
  * Access and monitor voyager lists.
* **Supervisor**

  * Oversee and manage orders placed by voyagers.
* **Manager**

  * Monitor bookings made by voyagers.
* **Voyager (Passenger)**

  * Browse and book cruises, meals, and resort services.
  * Place orders for catering/stationery items.
  * View bookings and orders in personal dashboard.

## 5. How to Run Instructions  

### Prerequisites  
- Firebase project configured with Authentication and Firestore.
- All files should be in their respective folders.

### Steps  
1. Edit the firebase.js files with your own firebase config.
2. Open `register.html` and register an account with desired role.
3. You will be logged in as your selected role.
4. If you logged in as **Voyager** you can Book/Order amenities and food. You can cancel bookings.

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Authentication

* Implemented using **Firebase Authentication**.
* Supports **secure login, registration, and logout**.
* Role-based redirection: Users are redirected to role-specific dashboards after login.

### 6.2 Dashboards

Each role has a separate dashboard:

* **Admin Dashboard**

  * Item management (add/remove catering items).
  * Voyager registration with email & password authentication.

* **Supervisor Dashboard**

  * Displays orders in card format (with vertical stacking when screen is smaller).

* **Manager Dashboard**

  * Displays bookings in card format (with responsive design).

* **Voyager Dashboard**

  * Explore cruises, meals, resorts, and other facilities.
  * Place catering or stationery orders.
  * Book services and view confirmed bookings.
